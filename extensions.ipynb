"# Extending Furnace\n",
"\n",
"Furnace provides most of the essential operations found in tensor libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). All differentiable operations support the forward, reverse, and nested differentiation modes.\n",
"\n",
"When implementing new operations, you should prefer to implement these as compositions of existing Furnace [Tensor](https://fsprojects.github.io/Furnace/reference/furnace-tensor.html) operations, which would give you differentiability out of the box.\n",
"\n",
"In the rare cases where you need to extend Furnace with a completely new differentiable operation that cannot be implemented as a composition of existing operations, you can use the provided extension API.\n",
"\n",
"## Simple elementwise functions\n",
"\n",
"If the function you would like to implement is a simple elementwise function, you can use the [UnaryOpElementwise](https://fsprojects.github.io/Furnace/reference/furnace-unaryopelementwise.html) or [BinaryOpElementwise](https://fsprojects.github.io/Furnace/reference/furnace-binaryopelementwise.html) types to define your function and its derivatives. The forward, reverse, and nested differentiation rules for the function are automatically generated by the type. The documentation of these two types detail how they should be instantiated.\n",
