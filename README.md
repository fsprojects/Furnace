Furnace is a tensor library with support for [differentiable programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming). It is designed for use in machine learning, probabilistic programming, optimization and other domains.

**Key features**

* Nested and mixed-mode differentiation
* Common optimizers, model elements, differentiable probability distributions
* F# for robust functional programming
* PyTorch familiar naming and idioms, efficient LibTorch CUDA/C++ tensors with GPU support
* Linux, macOS, Windows supported
* Use interactive notebooks in Jupyter and Visual Studio Code
* 100% open source

## Background

Furnace is a hard fork of DiffSharp. 

The original DiffSharp library was developed by [Atılım Güneş Baydin](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gunes/), [Don Syme](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/dsyme/) and other contributors, having started as a project supervised by the automatic differentiation wizards [Barak Pearlmutter](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AxFrw0sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jeffrey Siskind](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CgSBtPYAAAAJ&hl=en).
